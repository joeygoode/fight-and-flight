Fight and Flight
----------------

Josh, I really need those shaders to start looking done.
We've got an 8 page paper to write that I haven't even thought about.
Btw, you're stuck with world/projection/view matricies and whatever's
in the vertices.  If you absolutely need more vertex data, add it to the 
xml and I'll put in more parse support.  If you absolutely need a new uniform,
let me know, but no promises.  I've got a day to essentially breathe life into
this thing and I'm feeling the squeeze.  I've got no player control and I can't
even kill an entity.

Please get those shaders done so I don't have to worry about it.  It's a simple
matter to say when an entity with faction X dies to spawn a powerup, but I need
to have a way of being sure it works.  The sooner I can finish with the part of
this for CG, the better.

A lot of this essay is going to be on you.  I'll share my knowledge where I can,
but every last minute of time is going to breathing life into this, my theory
of comp final be damned.
